# DS_food-recipes
This project was done for the purpose of the subject "Introduction to Data Science".
The requirements are to find recipe Alternatives, using the Recipe 1M dataset to enrich the ingredients from each recipe with the corresponding macro-nutrient values from the USDA Food Data Central Dataset. The end goal is to identify similar recipies based on the ingredients on a macronutrient level and create a recommendation system.
